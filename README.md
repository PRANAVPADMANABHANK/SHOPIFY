Introduction
This project provides an API that allows users to analyze customer data and answer specific questions related to customer preferences and purchases. The data is fetched from a database and displayed in a user interface.

Technologies Used
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB (or any preferred database)
React.js (for the user interface)
HTML, CSS (for styling the user interface)
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
# Navigate to the API directory
cd api
npm install

# Navigate to the UI directory
cd ../ui
npm install
Configure the API:

Create a .env file in the api directory and set your database connection URL.

bash
Copy code
cd api
npm start
Start the UI development server:
bash
